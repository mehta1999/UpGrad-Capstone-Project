Project-2 -- FindDefault (Prediction of Credit Card fraud)
Problem Statement-- A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card or credit card information to make purchases or withdraw cash.
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. 
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
Techniques used in the project : Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, XGBoost.




The best results are achieved by XGBoost classifier. With this approach, the model is able to detect 100% of all fraudulent transactions in the unseen test set. This fully satisfies the primary objective to detect the vast majority of abnormal transactions.
